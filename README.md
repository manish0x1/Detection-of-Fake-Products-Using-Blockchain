# 🛡️ Detection of Fake Products Using Blockchain

## 📌 Introduction
Counterfeit products are a growing problem in global supply chains and e-commerce. They cause financial losses to manufacturers and pose serious risks to consumers, especially in industries like **pharmaceuticals, electronics, and luxury goods**.  
This project leverages **Blockchain technology** to provide a **decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof system** for product authentication. By storing product lifecycle data on the blockchain, consumers can easily verify authenticity and reduce fraud.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
- Increasing circulation of counterfeit products in supply chains  
- Lack of transparency and trust in product verification  
- Need for a **secure, decentralized solution** to track and validate product authenticity  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Register product details securely on blockchain  
- Assign unique identifiers (QR code / RFID / hash) to each product  
- Track product lifecycle across manufacturers, distributors, and retailers  
- Enable consumers to verify authenticity in real time  
- Detect fraud through mismatched or missing data
